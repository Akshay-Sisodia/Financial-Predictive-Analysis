# Setup Instructions

These instructions will guide you through setting up your environment to run the financial predictive analytics project. Before you begin, ensure you have the necessary prerequisites installed.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Akshay-Sisodia/financial-predictive-analytics.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Change your working directory to the project's root directory:

   ```bash
   cd financial-predictive-analytics
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional, but recommended)**

   It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment (Optional)**

   On Windows:

   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On macOS and Linux:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. **Install Required Packages**

   Install the project's required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Preprocess Data (Optional)**

   If you have your financial data and want to preprocess it, you can run the `preprocessing.py` script:

   ```bash
   python preprocessing.py
   ```

   This will generate a preprocessed data file (`preprocessed_data.csv`) in the project directory.

7. **Train the Model**

   To train the predictive model, run the `model_training.ipynb` notebook:

   ```bash
   python model_training.ipynb
   ```

   The trained model will be saved.

8. **Evaluate the Model**

   To evaluate the model's performance, run the `model_evaluation.ipynb` notebook:

   ```bash
   python model_evaluation.ipynb
   ```

   This script will provide evaluation metrics and display a plot of actual vs. predicted values.

9. **Customize and Extend**

   You can customize and extend the project by exploring different models, hyperparameters, or preprocessing techniques. Be sure to document your changes.

10. **Enjoy!**

   You're ready to use and extend the financial predictive analytics project for your specific needs.
