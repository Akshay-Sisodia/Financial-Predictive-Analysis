## Introduction

Financial markets are influenced by a multitude of factors, making them challenging to predict accurately. This project leverages machine learning techniques to forecast financial market trends and stock prices based on historical data. Three primary models are explored: Random Forest Regressor, ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), and Linear Regression.

## Project Overview

- `data_sources.md`: Information about the data source and data preprocessing.
- `model_explanation.md`: Explanation of selected machine learning models.
- `results/evaluation_metrics.txt`: Summary of model performance metrics.
- `results/model_visualizations/`: Visualizations of model predictions.
- `usage/usage_instructions.md`: Instructions on using the project code.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Akshay-Sisodia/financial-predictive-analytics.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd financial-predictive-analytics
   ```

3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. (Optional) Activate the virtual environment:

   On Windows:

   ```bash

   ```

## Data Sources

The historical data of INFY was obtained from Yahoo Finance. Refer to [data_sources.md](documentation/data_sources.md) for more details.

## Model Explanation

- Model: Random Forest Regressor
  - Description: The Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning technique known for its ability to handle complex relationships in financial data.
  - Parameters: [List of hyperparameters and their values]
  - Training Process: [Explanation of the training process]
  - Model Performance: [Performance metrics on the validation set]

## Model Performance

Refer to [evaluation_metrics.txt](results/evaluation_metrics.txt) for a summary of model performance metrics.

## Usage Instructions

- Preprocessing: Run `preprocessing.py` to preprocess raw financial data.
- Model Training: Train the predictive models using `model_training.py`.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance with `model_evaluation.py`.
- Customization: Customize and extend the project as needed. Document your changes.

Refer to [usage_instructions.md](usage/usage_instructions.md) for detailed usage instructions.
