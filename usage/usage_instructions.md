# Usage Instructions

This document provides instructions on how to use the financial predictive analytics project code.

## Prerequisites

Before using the project code, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Python**: Python 3.7 or higher.
- **pip**: The Python package manager.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Akshay-Sisodia/financial-predictive-analytics.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   Change your working directory to the project's root directory:

   ```bash
   cd financial-predictive-analytics
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)**:

   It's recommended to create a virtual environment for isolating project dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment (Optional)**:

   On Windows:

   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On macOS and Linux:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. **Install Required Packages**:

   Install project dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Preprocessing (Optional)

If you have your financial data, you can preprocess it using the following steps:

1. **Prepare Your Data**:

   Place your financial data file (e.g., `INFY.csv`) in the project directory.

2. **Run the Preprocessing Script**:

   Execute the preprocessing script to clean and preprocess your data:

   ```bash
   python preprocessing.py
   ```

   This will generate a preprocessed data file (`preprocessed_data.csv`) in the project directory.

## Model Training

To train the predictive models, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Model Training Script**:

   Execute the model training script to train the machine learning models:

   ```bash
   python model_training.py
   ```

   The trained models will be saved (you can uncomment the code to save them if needed).

## Model Evaluation

To evaluate the models' performance, use the following steps:

1. **Run the Model Evaluation Script**:

   Execute the model evaluation script to assess the models' performance:

   ```bash
   python model_evaluation.py
   ```

   This script will provide evaluation metrics and display a plot of actual vs. predicted values.
